<p>SPSSINC PROCESS FILES /HELP displays this help and does nothing else.</p>



<pre class="example"><code>SPSSINC PROCESS FILES DIRECTORY=&quot;c:/mydata/*.sav&quot;
SYNTAX=&quot;c:/myjobs/mysyntax.sps&quot; LOGFILE=&quot;c:/myjobs/log.txt&quot; 
VIEWERDIR=&quot;c:/myoutput&quot;
/MACRODEFS PARM1=&quot;x &gt; 10&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>INPUTDATA</strong> can specify a directory to process and, optionally, a file pattern.<br/>
For example,</p>

<pre><code>c:/mydata/x*.sav
</code></pre>

<p>would process all the sav files in directory c:\mydata whose names start with the letter x.
*.sav is assumed if DIRECTORY does not include a file pattern.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <strong>FILELIST</strong> specifies processing all of the files listed in the indicated file.<br/>
In order to use a file to specify the files that should be processed, create a file
with one name per line including the path to the file.  The names in the file must be enclosed
in double quotes (&ldquo;).  Anything following on the line is ignored.<br/>
Blank lines and lines starting with # are ignored.</p>

<p>The SPSSINC SPLIT DATASET command can produce a file in the correct format
for FILELIST.</p>

<p>Either INPUTDATA or FILELIST must be specified but not both.</p>

<p>The file of syntax specified in <strong>SYNTAX</strong> will be executed for each matching input file.<br/>
It should include the appropriate command to read the data file or other inputs using
the file handles or macros defined to refer to the input file and various output 
locations.  It is a common error to forget to open the input file in the syntax
file being applied.</p>

<p>The file handles are as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>JOB_INPUTFILE: The input file, including any directory path specified</li>
<li>JOB_DATADIR: The input data directory</li>
<li>JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR: The specified output data directory or <code>&lt;NONE&gt;</code></li>
<li>JOB_VIEWERDIR: The specified Viewer output directory or <code>&lt;NONE&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For a SAV file you could read the data with the command<br/>
<code>GET FILE=&quot;JOB_INPUTFILE&quot;.</code></p>

<p>Macros are defined with these same names except starting with &rdquo;!&ldquo;.  Two
additional macros are defined.</p>

<ul>
<li>!JOB_DATAFILEROOT: The name of the input data file without its extension and
excluding the path information</li>
<li>!JOB_DATAFILEEXT: The extension of the input data file</li>
</ul>

<p>Macro text is quoted.  Here is an example of code that might be used in the
syntax file to export output to the VIEWERDIR as an Excel file using the data file rootname.
The text !JOB or JOB is replaced by the root name specified in MACRONAME.</p>

<pre><code>define !out () !quote(!concat(!unquote(!eval(!job_viewerdir)), &quot;/&quot;, !unquote(!eval(!job_datafileroot)), &quot;.xls&quot;))
!enddefine.
output export /xls DOCUMENTFILE =!out.
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of reading a batch of Excel files and writing them as
sav files with the same base name but extension <em>sav</em>.</p>

<pre class="example"><code>define !out () !quote(!concat(!unquote(!eval(!JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR)),
    !unquote(!eval(!JOB_DATAFILEROOT)),
    &quot;.sav&quot;)) !enddefine.

GET DATA /TYPE=XLSX
  /FILE=JOB_INPUTFILE
  /SHEET=name &#39;Sheet1&#39;
  /CELLRANGE=full  /READNAMES=on
  /ASSUMEDSTRWIDTH=100.

SAVE OUTFILE=!out.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BEFORESYNTAX</strong> and <strong>AFTERSYNTAX</strong> can specify syntax files to be executed
before or after any input files are processed.  The before file will have all the file handles
and macros as set for the first input file, and the after file will have these items as set
for the last file processed.  These files are typically used to initialize the iterations
and clean up at the end of the job.</p>

<p>A serious error in BEFORESYNTAX always stops processing.  The
<strong>CONTINUEONERROR</strong> setting determines whether the AFTERSYNTAX file is
executed if there is an error.</p>

<p>Instead of SYNTAX, <strong>SEARCH</strong> can be specified to search files according to
parameters passed as !PARM1, !PARM2, and !PARM3.
!PARM1 defines the search condition as a boolean expression as would be
used with SELECT IF.
!PARM2 is the id variable. !PARM3 is any other variables to be listed with the results.
Either SYNTAX or SEARCH must be specified but not both.</p>

<p>If <strong>CLOSEDATA</strong> is YES, all data files are automatically closed 
after each syntax file invocation.</p>

<p>It may be convenient to use this procedure in combination with SPSSINC SPLIT DATASET,
which can break up a dataset according to the values of a splitting variable.</p>

<p>If <strong>OUTPUTDATADIR</strong> is specified, after the syntax completes for each iteration
the active data file will be written as an .sav file to that directory .
This can be useful when carrying out transformations for a set of files.
You can, of course, leave this field blank and write any data file output you choose.<br/>
The <code>JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR</code> file handle and <code>!JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR</code> macro 
identify the data output location specified in PROCESS FILES.</p>

<p>Viewer output can be saved either in a separate spv file for each data file or as a single
file for the entire job by specifying either <strong>VIEWERDIR</strong> or <strong>VIEWERFILE</strong>
and entering either a directory name or a file specification.  </p>

<p>If VIEWERFILE specifies only a directory, the file will be named VIEWER.SPV.</p>

<p><strong>LOGFILE</strong> specifies a file that will contain a log of actions carried out by
PROCESS FILES (not what happens in the invoked syntax), including an entry if
the syntax generates a serious error (level 3 or higher).  </p>

<p><strong>LOGFILEMODE</strong> can be APPEND or OVERWRITE.  The file is written in Unicode (utf-8).</p>

<p>If a serious error occurs while executing the syntax file, you can choose whether 
to continue processing with the next data file or to stop processing any further 
files by specifying <strong>CONTINUEONERROR</strong> = YES or NO.
If possible, the output data and Viewer files will still be written for the data file
that caused the error even if stopping is specified.</p>

<h2>MACRODEFS</h2>

<p>MACRODEFS can be used to define macros that can be referenced in
the syntax file that is repeatedly executed.  Each macro name matches the PARMn
or QPARMn parameter with a preceding !.  These macros are defined after the 
macros described above each time a file is processed, so they can refer to the 
stadard macro values.
The definition will be wrapped in quotes and hence be interpreted as a literal
if QPARM is used.  The parameters must always be quoted in the MACRODEFS
subcommand.</p>

<p>If a macro is not explicitly defined, it will automatically be defined as empty.</p>

<p>Example:  with this syntax</p>

<pre><code>/MACRODEF PARM1=&quot;education &gt;= 12 and education &lt;=16&quot; PARM2=&quot;educ age&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>the syntax job could contain this code to do frequencies on qualifying data.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT IF !PARM1.
FREQ !PARM2.
</code></pre>

<p>This construct could also be used to search for a particular id, say, across files</p>

<pre><code>/MACRODEF PARM1=&quot;ID = 12345&quot; PARM2 = &quot;ID&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>and, in the syntax file,</p>

<pre><code>SELECT IF !PARM1.
FREQ !PARM2.
</code></pre>

<p>But for a literal, say, as a table title, you would use QPARM:</p>

<pre><code>CTABLES ...  /TITLES TITLE=!QPARM1.
... /MACRODEFS QPARM1=&quot;The Title&quot;.
</code></pre>

<p>In these examples, you should use CONTINUEONERROR=YES, since
the SELECT will result in 0 cases in the data if none meet the criteria.</p>

<p>A complete version of a search syntax file is included with this package.</p>

<p>If any of the file or directory specifications to this command use SPSS file handles,
these will be expanded properly in Statistics version 18 or later, but in earlier versions, they
will not work with directory specifications or where a wildcard expression is
allowed.</p>
