  <h1>Apply a Syntax File to a Set of Data Files</h1>This procedure
  provides a way to loop through a collection of data files and
  apply the same set of syntax to each. The syntax may contain any
  commands. Macros and file handles are provided to refer to the
  inputs and the output specifications.

  <p>It may be convenient to use this procedure in combination with
  SPSSINC SPLIT DATASET, which can break up a dataset according to
  the values of a splitting variable.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Input Data Files Specified by Wildcard
  Expression.</span> Choose a directory to process and, optionally,
  specify a file pattern. For example,<br>
  c:\mydata\x*.sav<br>
  would process all the sav files in directory c:\mydata whose
  names start with the letter x.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• If no file-name expression is given,*.sav is
  assumed.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• You must choose either this option or the
  following <span class="screen">Input Data</span> option but not
  both.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Input Data Files Specified in a
  File.</span> Process all the files listed in the specified file.
  The SPSSINC SPLIT DATASET command can produce a file in the
  correct format.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• You must choose either this option or the
  preceding <span class="screen">Input Data</span> option but not
  both.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Syntax File to Execute for Each Data
  File.</span> The syntax file will be invoked for each input
  dataset. It should read the file and carry out any desired
  operations. File handles and macros are defined to refer to the
  input file and various output locations. The file handles are as
  follows.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>JOB_INPUTFILE: The input file.</li>

    <li>JOB_DATADIR: The input data directory</li>

    <li>JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR: The specified output data directory or
    <i>&lt;NONE&gt;</i></li>

    <li>JOB_VIEWERDIR: The specified Viewer output directory or
    <i>&lt;NONE&gt;</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="bullet">• For a SAV file you could read the data with
  the command<br>
  GET FILE="JOB_INPUTFILE".</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Macros are defined with these same names
  except starting with "!". Two additional macros are defined.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>!JOB_DATAFILEROOT: The name of the input data file without
    its extension</li>

    <li>!JOB_DATAFILEEXT: The extension of the input data file</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The text <i>!JOB</i> or <i>JOB</i> is replaced by the root
  name specified in the root-name control.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Macro text is quoted. Here is an example of
  code that could be used to export Viewer contents to the
  specified Viewer directory using the name of the data file with
  extension .xls.<br></p>

  <p class="code">DEFINE !out ()
  !QUOTE(!CONCAT(!EVAL(!UNQUOTE(!JOB_VIEWERDIR)), "/",
  !EVAL(!unquote(!JOB_DATAFILEROOT)), ".xls"))<br>
  !ENDDEFINE.<br>
  OUTPUT EXPORT /XLS DOCUMENTFILE =!out.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Directory for Output Data
  Files.</span> If specified, for each dataset the data file will
  be written as an .sav file to that directory after the syntax
  completes. This can be useful when carrying out transformations
  for a set of files. You can, of course, leave this field blank
  and write any data file output you choose. The JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR
  file handle or !JOB_OUTPUTDATADIR macro identifies the data
  output location specified in this command</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Viewer Output.</span> Viewer output
  can be saved either in a separate file for each data file or as a
  single file for the entire job. Select the appropriate radio
  button, and enter either a directory name or a file
  specification. If you choose to write a single file but enter
  only a directory in the following control, the file will be named
  <i>VIEWER.SPV</i>. The Browse button for that control only allows
  a directory to be specified, but you can type in a file name.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Write Job Log to File.</span> Specify
  a file for the job log. The log lists the files processed and
  written by the procedure, each with a time stamp.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Operations carried out by the syntax file are
  not recorded.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• If a serious error occurs in processing a
  file, there will be an error entry in the log.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Syntax to Execute before
  Processing.</span> You can specify a syntax file that will be
  executed once before input file processing starts. Macros and
  file handles will be defined as for the first file in the
  processing list. If a serious error occurs, processing is
  stopped.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Syntax to Execute after All
  Processing.</span> You can specify a syntax file that will be
  executed once after all the input files are processed. Macros and
  file handles will be defined as for the last file in the
  processing list.</p>

  <h2>Options</h2>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Log File Mode.</span> Choose whether
  the log entries for the job are appended to an existing file or
  replace the contents.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Data File Processing after Each
  Step.</span> Choose <span class="screen">Close</span> to have all
  datasets closed after each iteration of input file processing.
  Leaving datasets open after each step is useful if you are
  combining many datasets into one. The final dataset could be
  saved after this command completes.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Error Handling.</span> If an error
  occurs, you can choose whether to continue processing with the
  next data file or to stop processing any further files. If
  possible, the output data and Viewer files will still be written
  for the data file that caused the error even if stopping is
  specified.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Root name for macros and file
  handles.</span> By default, the file handles and macros defined
  have the prefix JOB and !JOB, respectively followed by an
  underscore. You can specify a different prefix in place of JOB.
  The prefix will have ! prepended to it for macros.<i>!</i>.</p>

  <h2>Macro Definitions</h2>

  <p>Use this subdialog box to define your own macros that can be
  used in the syntax file. You can define up to five macros named
  !PARM1 to !PARM5 whose values will be ordinary syntax or variable
  names, and up to five macros named !QPARM1 to !QPARM5 whose
  values will be quoted literal strings. The quoted string are
  useful for titles or string expressions in transformations.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Macros Where Values Are
  Unquoted.</span> Enter any macro text that represents any SPSS
  syntax that should appear without quotation marks.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Macros Where Value Is a Quoted
  Literal.</span> Enter any macro text that represents SPSS syntax
  that should appear in quotation marks such as a title, label, or
  file name.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Use single quotes (') if you need to quote
  literals in the definition. The generated macro text will be
  enclosed in double quotes(").</p>

  <h3>A Macro Example to Search Data Files for a Particular Case
  ID</h3>Suppose some set of files have an ID variable named
  PatientID, and you would like to find all occurrences of the id
  "Johann Schmidt". You could use the following fragment in your
  syntax file. <code><br>
  SELECT IF !PARM1 EQ !QPARM1.<br>
  FREQUENCIES !PARM1.</code><br>
  where you enter PatientID in the PARM1 field and Johann Schmidt
  in the QPARM1 field.

  <p class="bullet">• Set the Error Handling parameter to Continue
  with next file since if no cases are selected, the FREQUENCIES
  command will generate an error. (OMS could be used to suppress
  the resulting Warnings table.)</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Write the Viewer output to a single file for
  ease of viewing the result.</p>

  <h2>A Data Searching Utility</h2>See Edit&gt;Search Data Files
  for a dialog that uses this command to search the cases in a set
  of SAV files.

  <h2>Additional Features</h2>Run the command<br>
  SPSSINC PROCESS FILES /HELP.<br>
  to display the entire syntax description. Using syntax, the ouput
  can be written to the current working directory of the SPSS
  Processor. The command SHOW DIRECTORY displays the name of that
  directory.

  <p>In order to use a file to specify the files that should be
  processed, create a file with one name per line including the
  path to the file. The name must be enclosed in double quotes (").
  Anything following on the line is ignored. Blank lines and lines
  starting with # are ignored.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>This command requires the Python
  Programmability Plug-in, You can find the Python plug-in on the
  IBM SPSS Statistics CD, or you can download it from SPSS
  Developer Central (www.spss.com/devcentral).
